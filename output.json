I) Thermal engineering encompasses a broad range of topics that include the behavior of matter and energy and their interaction as part of a system with the surrounding environment. This course covers topics from the fields of thermodynamics and heat transfer. You will learn how to identify systems and to use thermodynamic analysis to describe the behavior of the system in terms of properties and processes. Heat transfer between systems is a fundamental part of many engineering disciplines. While thermodynamics provides the foundation for understanding the energy distribution in a system in equilibrium, heat transfer provides a means for determining the rates of energy transfer under a variety of conditions. Understanding how to apply these concepts is a powerful tool for the engineer, enabling the evaluation of material states (phases) under different conditions and the maximum efficiency achievable with various power cycles. After completing this course, you should be able to define and describe properties and processes used in thermodynamic analysis and the governing laws. You should also be able to define and describe the phenomena of conduction, convection, and radiation and apply the heat diffusion equation to determine the temperature distribution in objects subject to different thermal boundary conditions. Finally, you should be able to calculate the heat transfer rates for objects subject to different (and combined) modes of heat transfer. Recommended background: basic physics, (PH 1110, PH 1111) elementary differential and integral calculus (MA 1021, MA 1022), ordinary differential equations (MA2051) or equivalent.",

        "description": "This course studies, in a non-technical way, America's buildings and places, in the context of world architecture in modern times. The history of American architecture was shaped by the forces that shaped America, from its political emergence in the eighteenth century to the post-9\\11 era. These forces include dreams of social and spiritual perfection; a tight and conflicted relation with nature; and the rise and spread of industrial capitalism. The same forces created the Modern Movement in architecture. How are modernism and American architecture interrelated? Illustrated lectures, films, and tours of Worcester architecture explore the question while training students in the methods of architectural history and criticism. Students who have taken AR 2113, Topics in 19th- and 20th-Century Architecture, since the 2000-2001 academic year MAY NOT take AR 2114 for credit.",

The specific topics include physical theories about light, biological and psychological theories of visual perception, and artistic theories and practices concerned with representation. The mixing of material from different academic disciplines is deliberate and meant to counter the notion that human pursuits are \u201cnaturally\u201d arranged in the neat packages found in the modern university. The course draws upon the physical and social sciences, and the humanities, to examine how those fields relate to one another, and how they produce knowledge and self-knowledge. Cultural as well as disciplinary factors are assessed in this process. Light, Vision, and Understanding is conducted as a seminar. The diverse collection of reading materials includes a number of primary texts in different fields. In addition, the students keep a journal in which they record the results of numerous individual observations and experiments concerning light and visual perception. The course can fit into several areas of depth as well as serve as a starting point for an IQP. There are no specific requirements for this course, although some knowledge of college-level physics, as well as an acquaintance with the visual arts, is helpful. This course will be offered in 2020-21, and in alternating years thereafter.",

Analyzing these kinds of data requires quantitative knowledge and approaches using computer science and mathematics . In this project-based course, students will use case studies to learn about both important biological problems and the computational tools and algorithms used to study them . Students will study a sampling of topics in the field; recent topics included complex disease genetics, HIV evolution, antibiotic resistance, and animal migration behavior . In addition, students will hear from several guest speakers about their interdisciplinary research . Computational tools explored will include both freely-available tools to analyze sequences and build phylogenetic trees (e .g . BLAST, MUSCLE, MEGA) as well as guided programming using languages such as Python, R, and Netlogo . Students may not receive credit for both BCB \\ BB 100X and BCB \\ BB 1003 . BBT majors may count this course as fulfilling part of their quantitative science and engineering requirement, but not as part of their BB 1000 level course requirement . Recommended background: High school biology . Programming experience is not required .",

In the first half of the 20th century, this trend accelerated with the rise of redlining, zoning, financial racism, and urban renewal to enforce racial segregation in American cities. At the close of the 20th century, the forces of privatization, deregulation and globalization compounded already dire urban environmental inequities. This course allows student to appreciate how historical urban land use shapes urban ecological patterns and how biological laboratory practices connect to and inform on-going struggles for environmental justice in a postindustrial city. To achieve this integration \u2013 the ground underfoot \u2013 the soil and its microorganisms as well as the history of its use \u2013 will provide the foundation upon which to build connection between biological and historical methodologies. While many recent discussions in urban ecology and design have revolved around \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d and its role in climate resiliency, food justice, heat island mitigation, toxic sequestration, and stormwater management, this course will explore the soils that serves as the foundation for all \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d by supporting broader ecosystem service in the city. Students will register for the course either as BBT 292X or HI331X. The course cannot be double counted or receive credit in both disciplines.",

I This beginning course provides important background for all science and engineering disciplines regarding the capabilities and limitations of materials relevant to the development of medical devices. Students are introduced to the fundamental theme of materials science-- structureproperty-processing relationships in biomaterials, specifically metals, ceramics, and plastics. Aspects of material structure range from the atomic to microstructural and macroscopic scales. In turn, these structural features determine the properties of materials. In particular, this course investigates connections between structure and mechanical properties, and how working and thermal treatments may transform structure and thus alter material properties. This knowledge is then applied to material selection decisions for the design of medical devices and engineered tissues. Recommended background: prior knowledge of college-level chemistry and physics. Students who have previously received credit for ES 2001 or BME 2811 may not receive credit for BME 2001.",

        "description": "Biomaterials are an integral part of medical devices, implants, controlled drug delivery systems, and tissue engineered constructs. Extensive research efforts have been expended on understanding how biologic systems interact with biomaterials. Meanwhile, controversy has revolved around biomaterials and their availability as a result of the backlash to the huge liability resulting from controversies related to material and processing shortcomings of medical devices. This course specifically addresses the unique role of biomaterials in medical device design and the use of emerging biomaterials technology in medical devices. The need to understand design requirements of medical devices based on safety and efficacy will be addressed. Unexpected device failure can occur if testing fails to account for synergistic interactions from chronic loading, aqueous environments, and biologic interactions. Testing methodologies are readily available to assess accelerated effects of loading in physiologic-like environments. This combined with subchronic effects of animal implants is a potential tool in assessing durability. It is difficult to predict the chronic effects of the total biologic environment. The ultimate determination of safety comes not only from following the details of regulations, but with an understanding of potential failure modes and designs that lowers the risk of these failures. This course will evaluate biomaterials and their properties as related to the design and reliability of medical devices.",

I This course will examine the dynamic nature of solutions at the molecular level, and will develop an understanding of the mathematical aspects of molecular dynamics and equilibrium. Reaction kinetics will be outlined in detail leading into exploration of various fundamentals and examples of equilibrium processes in the gas phase as well as in solution, including acid-base chemistry and precipitation. Principles of thermodynamics will be introduced (entropy, free energy), and relationships with equilibrium will be explored. Case studies in current topics will be emphasized throughout the course. Recommended background: Properties of matter, basic bonding theory, Lewis structures and molecular orbitals, intermolecular forces. Redox reactions, solution thermodynamics, colligative properties, balancing of chemical reactions. See CH1010 and CH1020.",

        "description": "Cat. I The content of this course will be the development of the principles of classical thermodynamics. The laws of thermodynamics will be developed by using a series of increasingly complex model systems and a universal equation of state is formulated which incorporates the relationships illustrated by these model systems. Using this equation it will be possible to appreciate that thermodynamic laws are applicable to all systems of matter, regardless of their complexity. Finally, the principles developed are applied to problems of a chemical nature, focusing on predicting the spontaneity of chemical reactions. The material in this course will be of greatest interest to those students enrolled in the basic sciences including biology, chemistry, and physics, and in applied fields such as chemical engineering, materials science and biotechnology. Recommended background: Students should be familiar with the material covered in the general chemistry sequence CH 1010-1040, and calculus including multi variables.",

The second half of the term is a preview of selected advanced Computer Science topics, such as the design and implementation of application-specific languages, macros, programming with the HTTP protocol and continuation-passing style. Students will be expected to complete an open-ended individual programming project. Recommended background: Substantial prior programming experience (including functions, recursion, and lists, as would be covered in high-school Advanced Placement Computer Science A courses, but not necessarily AP CS Principles courses). Either CS 1101 or CS 1102 provides sufficient background for further courses in the CS department. Undergraduate credit may not be earned for both this course and CS 1101.",

Building from the design methodology covered in CS 1101\\CS 1102, this course shows how programs can be decomposed into classes and objects. By emphasizing design, this course shows how to implement small defect-free programs and evaluate design decisions to select an optimal design under specific assumptions. Topics include inheritance, exceptions, interface, design by contract, basic design patterns, and reuse. Students will be expected to design, implement, and debug object-oriented programs composed of multiple classes and over a variety of data structures. Recommended background: CS 1101 or CS 1102.",

The course covers object-oriented design principles and data structures more deeply and at a faster pace than in CS 2102. Students will be expected to design, implement, test, debug, and critique programs both for correctness and adherence to good object-oriented design principles. The course is designed to strengthen both the design skills and algorithmic thinking of students who already have a foundation in object-oriented programming. Recommended background: CS 1101 or CS 1102 and significant prior experience writing object-oriented programs from scratch. Advanced Placement Computer Science A courses should provide sufficient background; students from AP CS Principles courses or gentler introductions to Java Programming are advised to take CS 2102 instead. Students may receive credit for only one of the following three courses: CS 2102, CS 210X, CS 2103.",

This course will focus on the practical AI programming techniques currently used in computer games for NPC navigation and decision-making, along with the design issues that arise when AI is applied in computer games, such as believability and real-time performance. The course will also briefly discuss future directions in applying AI to games and media. Students will be expected to complete significant software development projects using the studied techniques. Recommended background: object-oriented design concepts (CS 2102 or CS 2103), algorithms (CS 2223), and knowledge of technical game development (IMGD 3000).

Specific topics include basic direct and iterative methods for linear systems; classical rootfinding methods; Newton's method and related methods for nonlinear systems; fixed-point iteration; polynomial, piecewise polynomial, and spline interpolation methods; least-squares approximation; orthogonal functions and approximation; basic techniques for numerical differentiation; numerical integration, including adaptive quadrature; and methods for initial-value problems for ordinary differential equations. Additional topics may be included at the instructor's discretion as time permits. Both theory and practice are examined. Error estimates, rates of convergence, and the consequences of finite precision arithmetic are also discussed. Topics from linear algebra and elementary functional analysis will be introduced as needed. These may include norms and inner products, orthogonality and orthogonalization, operators and projections, and the concept of a function space. (Prerequisite: knowledge of undergraduate linear algebra and differential equations is assumed, as is familiarity with MATLAB or a higher-level programming language.)",

These models are trained based on realistic example data sets from the real world. This course covers the underlying fundamentals of generative models. It also introduces the design and modeling of some of the modern generative models: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion models, ChatGPT, Large Language Models, to name a few. Several applications will be discussed, ranging from image generation for engineering or science applications to the utilization of generated data for data augmentation in AI systems. Ethical concerns related to the danger of these generative technologies concerning issues from misinformation, bias, to data ownership are reviewed.

Case studies considering societal challenges caused by AI technologies may include AI-based hiring recommendations stemming from societal biases present in training datasets, AI-empowered selfdriving cars behaving in a dangerous manner when encountering atypical road conditions, digital health applications inadvertently revealing private patient information, or large language models like chat-GPT generating incorrect or harmful responses. This course also studies AI-based algorithmic solutions to some of these challenges. These include the design of robust machine learning algorithms with constraints to ensure fairness, privacy, and safety. Strategies for how to apply these methods to design safe and fair AI are introduced. Topics may include min-max optimization with applications to training machine learning models robust to adversarial attacks, stochastic methods for preserving privacy of sensitive data, and multi-agent machine learning models for reducing algorithmic bias and polarization in recommender systems.

The computer representation of this information about a user is called a user model, and systems that construct and utilize such models are called user modeling systems. A simple example of a user model would be an e-commerce site which makes use of the user's and similar users' purchasing and browsing behavior in order to better understand the user's preferences. In this class, the focus is on obtaining a general understanding of user modeling, and an understanding of how to apply user modeling techniques. Students will read seminal papers in the user modeling literature, as well as complete a course project where students build a system that explicitly models the user .

The course begins with the introduction of the concepts of data security, where classical algorithms serve as an example. Different attacks on cryptographic systems are classified. Some pseudo-random generators are introduced. The concepts of public and private key cryptography are developed. As important representatives for secret key schemes, DES and IDEA are described. The public key schemes RSA and ElGamal, and systems based on elliptic curves are then developed. Signature algorithms, hash functions, key distribution and identification schemes are treated as advanced topics. Some advanced mathematical algorithms for attacking cryptographic schemes are discussed. Application examples will include a protocol for security in a LAN and a secure smart card system for electronic banking. Special consideration will be given to schemes which are relevant for network environments. For all schemes, implementation aspects and up-to-date security estimations will be discussed.

Implementation of performance security aspects of the algorithms will be looked at. The second part of the course deals with advanced protocols. New schemes for authentication, identification and zero-knowledge proof will be introduced. Some complex protocols for real-world application\u2014 such as key distribution in networks and for smart cards\u2014will be introduced and analyzed. The third part will look into state-of-the-art cryptoanalysis (i.e., ways to break cryptosystems). Brute force attacks based on special purpose machines, the baby-step giantstep and the Pohlig-Hellman algorithms will be discussed. (Prerequisites: ECE 578\\ CS 578 or equivalent background.)",

Students will learn the assessment of the needs and concerns of stakeholders, the knowledge of analytical tools, including randomized-controlled trials (RCTs), and the ability to formulate evidence-based recommendations. We begin by examining the advantages and disadvantages of using observational studies to identify the determinants of outcomes in which policy makers are often interested. We then consider quasi-experiments and learn about their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we focus on how to use RCTs in the field to obtain accurate measures of policy effectiveness. We will cover a significant amount of literature on education, health, agricultural, and finance-related interventions. You will also complete a research project that will give you the opportunity to develop the skills necessary to successfully design, conduct, and analyze the results of RCTs aimed at answering important policy questions. Recommended background: Basic knowledge of the common methods (qualitative and quantitative) that are typically used for evaluating development-related policy and interventions.

Topics covered will include predictive modeling, feature engineering, and model assessment, with a particular focus on the small-data limit. We will analyze and apply algorithms with wide applicability in engineering and sciences including classic techniques such as multiple linear regression and random forests, and state-of-the-art techniques such as deep neural networks. Recommended Background: The intention is for the class to be accessible to a wide audience in disciplines outside of Computer Science and Data Science, though some basic background topics such as statistics or linear algebra, and the ability to learn Python programming at a basic level would be helpful.",

        "description": "Big Data Analytics addresses the obstacle that innovation and discoveries are no longer hindered by the ability to collect data, but by the ability to summarize, analyze, and discover knowledge from the collected data in a scalable fashion. This course covers computational techniques and algorithms for analyzing and mining patterns in large-scale datasets. Techniques studied address data analysis issues related to data volume (scalable and distributed analysis), data velocity (high-speed data streams), data variety (complex, heterogeneous, or unstructured data), and data veracity (data uncertainty). Techniques include mining and machine learning techniques for complex data types, and scale-up and scale-out strategies that leverage big data infrastructures. Real-world applications using these techniques, for instance social media analysis and scientific data mining, are selectively discussed. Students are expected to engage in hands-on projects using one or more of these technologies. Prerequisites: A beginning course in databases and a beginning course in data mining, or equivalent knowledge, and programming experience.",

        "description": "Cat. I This course investigates commonly used sensors such as resistive temperature sensors, capacitive touch sensors, and inductive motion sensors and actuators. Numerous applications are presented to motivate coverage of fundamental operating principles of circuit elements such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors; model the signals produced by these sensors; and analyze the circuits and systems used to amplify and process these signals. After a review of Kirchhoff \u2018s current and voltage laws, fundamental analysis techniques such as Thevenin and Norton's theorems and the superposition principle are used to model and analyze sensors, circuits, and systems. Concepts from analysis of linear, time-invariant continuous-time signals and systems are introduced as necessary, including Fourier series and characterization of systems such as filters in both the frequency domain (bandwidth, transfer function) and time domain (rise time, step response). Capacitance, inductance and mutual inductance are explored as energy storage elements, including consideration of resonance and energy losses in power systems. Concepts will be reinforced with the use of laboratory exercises and computer simulation. Recommended background: ECE 2010, MA 1024 (or equivalent), PH 1120\\21 and MA 2051 (concurrent).

        "description": "Cat. I Digital circuits are the foundation upon which the computers, cell phones, and calculators we use every day are built. This course explores these foundations by using modern digital design techniques to design, implement and test digital circuits ranging in complexity from basic logic gates to state machines that perform useful functions like calculations, counting, timing, and a host of other applications. Students will learn modern design techniques, using a hardware description language (HDL) such as Verilog to design, simulate and implement logic systems consisting of basic gates, adders, multiplexers, latches, and counters. The function and operation of programmable logic devices, such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), will be described and discussed in terms of how an HDL logic design is mapped and implemented. Experiments involving the design of combinational and sequential circuits will provide students a hands-on introduction to basic digital electrical engineering concepts and the skills needed to gain more advanced skills. In the laboratory, students will construct, troubleshoot, and test the digital circuits that they have developed using a hardware description language. These custom logic designs will be implemented using FPGAs and validated using test equipment. Topics: Number representations, Boolean algebra, design and simplification of combinational circuits, arithmetic circuits, analysis and design of sequential circuits, and synchronous state machines. Lab exercises: Design, analysis and construction of combinational and sequential circuits; use of hardware description languages to implement, test, and verify digital circuits; function and operation of FPGAs. Recommended background: Introductory Electrical and Computer Engineering concepts covered in a course such as ECE 2010 or RBE 1001, and MA 1022.

I) Computational Engineering describes the methods and practices of software programming in the context of electrical and computer engineering (ECE), specifically, the construction of programs to be efficiently implemented on hardware. In this regard, the course covers programming design and methodology, developing efficient code using C programming language, hardware device abstraction, and modeling. In doing so, starting with basic programming techniques in the high-level programming language C, the course describes the relevant software and hardware device abstraction levels. Additionally, program analysis, debugging methods, issues encountered when interfacing with signals to\\from external devices, and computer engineering models, such as finite state machines and timing in computing hardware, are explained. The course uses assignments\\projects to provide hands-on experience with software programming to solve problems in electrical and computer engineering practice.

        "description": "ECE 2049 Embedded Computing in Engineering Design (1\\3 Units; Cat. I) Embedded computers are literally everywhere in modern life. On any given day we interact with and depend on dozens of small computers to make coffee, run cell phones, take pictures, play music, control elevators, manage the emissions and antilock brakes in our automobile, control a home security system, and so on. Using popular everyday devices as case studies, students in this course are introduced to the unique computing and design challenges posed by embedded systems. Students will then solve real-world design problems using small, resource constrained (time\\memory\\power) computing platforms. The hardware and software structure of modern embedded devices and basic interactions between embedded computers and the physical world will also be covered in lecture and as part of laboratory experiments. In the laboratory, emphasis is placed on interfacing embedded processors with common sensors and devices (e.g. temperature sensors, keypads, LCD displays, SPI ports, pulse width modulated motor controller outputs) while developing the skills needed to use embedded processors in systems design. This course is also appropriate for RBE and other engineering and CS students interested in learning about embedded system theory and design. Topics: Number\\data representations, embedded system design using C, microprocessor and microcontroller architecture, program development and debugging tools for a small target processor, hardware\\software dependencies, use of memory mapped peripherals, design of event driven software, time and resource management, applications case studies. Lab Exercises: Students will solve commonly encountered embedded processing problems to implement useful systems. Starting with a requirements list students will use the knowledge gained during the lectures to implement solutions to problems which explore topics such as user interfaces and interfacing with the physical world, logic flow, and timing and time constrained programming. Exercises will be performed on microcontroller and\\or microprocessor based embedded systems using cross platform development tools appropriate to the target platform. Note: Students who have received credit for ECE 2801 may not receive credit for ECE 2049. Students may not receive credit for both RBE 2020 and ECE 2049. Recommended Background ECE 2039 (preferred for ECE majors) or a course in C language programming such as CS 2301\\3 or equivalent; and ECE 2010 or equivalent knowledge in basic circuits, devices and analysis. Suggested Background: ECE 2029 or equivalent knowledge of digital logic, logic signals, and logic operations.",

I The object of this course is a comprehensive treatment of electromagnetic engineering principles covering the entire application spectrum from static to dynamic field phenomena. The starting point will be the basic electric and magnetic field definitions of Coulomb and Biot-Savart leading to Gauss's and Ampere's laws. They form the foundation of electro- and magnetostatics fields. Students will examine capacitive and inductive systems and relate them to lumped element circuit models. By introducing temporal and spatial magnetic flux variations, Faraday's law is established. The engineering implications of this law are investigated in terms of transformer and motor actions. Incorporation of the displacement current density into Ampere's law and combining it with Faraday's law will then culminate in the complete set of Maxwell's field equations. As a result of these equations, students will develop the concept of wave propagation in the time and frequency domain with practical applications such as wireless communication, radar, Global Positioning Systems, and microwave circuits.

        "description": "Cat. I This course covers the systematic design of advanced digital systems using FPGAs. The emphasis is on top-down design starting with high level models using a hardware description language (such as VHDL or Verilog) as a tool for the design, synthesis, modeling, test bench development, and testing and verification of complete digital systems. These types of systems include the use of embedded soft core processors as well as lower level modules created from custom logic or imported IP blocks. Interfaces will be developed to access devices external to the FPGA such as memory or peripheral communication devices. The integration of tools and design methodologies will be addressed through a discussion of system on a chip (SOC) integration, methodologies, design for performance, and design for test. Topics: Hardware description languages, system modeling, synthesis, simulation and testing of digital circuits; Design integration to achieve specific system design goals including architecture, planning and integration, and testing; Use of soft core and IP modules to meet specific architecture and design goals. Laboratory exercises: Students will design and implement a complete sophisticated embedded digital system on an FPGA. HDL design of digital systems including lower level components and integration of higher level IP cores, simulating the design with test benches, and synthesizing and implementing these designs with FPGA development boards including interfacing to external devices.

Very often, electric power must be converted from one form to another to meet a specific application need \u2013 this conversion process is accomplished through the use and efficient management of power electronics. Design of power electronics is introduced first by examining the performance characteristics of basic switching devices, which enable critical management functions that include pulse width modulation (PWM) and output power regulation. Half and full-wave AC source rectification and techniques for improving the resulting DC power characteristics are covered, including polyphase AC sources. AC voltage control with applications for induction motors is studied. DC-DC power conversion is examined, covering a variety of circuit architectures, with applications in feedback control. DC to AC power inversion and resulting power quality considerations are explored. The impacts of design decisions on power electronics systems, from micro- to megawatts, are demonstrated through numerical simulation. This course includes guest lectures, project work including case-studies and selected power system demonstrations. Recommended background: ECE 3204, ECE 3501.

To develop a fundamental understanding of CMOS integrated circuit design and layout, the course begins with a description of integrated circuit fabrication technology and crucial process layers to fabricate devices in CMOS technology. With this foundation, we discuss resistors and capacitors in integrated circuit technology, followed by MOSFET capacitors and MOSFET transistors, emphasizing concepts in nanoCMOS devices such as velocity saturation and drain-induced barrier lowering. Building on earlier concepts in this course, we develop models for analog and digital integrated circuit design using MOSFET. Next, the students will learn the concept of basic digital building blocks in CMOS technology and associated timing and loading constraints. Finally, the course explores matching and sensitivity concepts through a simple circuit example, a current mirror.

The application of some simple rules of thumb and design techniques is a possible first step to developing intuition into the behavior of complex electrical systems.

Integrated amplifier circuits are developed with an emphasis on understanding performance advantages and limitation in such areas as speed, noise and power dissipation. Simple circuits are combined to form the basic functional building blocks such as the op-amp, comparator, voltage reference, etc. These circuit principles will be explored in an IC design project, which may be fabricated in a commercial analog process. Examples of possible topics include sample-and-hold (S\\H) amplifier, analogto-digital (A\\D) and digital-to-analog (D\\A) converters, phase-locked loop (PLL), voltagecontrolled oscillator, phase detector, switched capacitor and continuous-time filters, and sampled current techniques. Prerequisite: Background in analog circuits both at the transistor and functional block [op-amp, comparator, etc.] level. Also familiarity with techniques such as small-signal modeling and analysis in the s-plane using Laplace transforms. Undergraduate course equivalent background ECE 3204; ECE 4902 helpful but not essential.",

The public key schemes RSA and ElGamal, and systems based on elliptic curves are then developed. Signature algorithms, hash functions, key distribution and identification schemes are treated as advanced topics. Some advanced mathematical algorithms for attacking cryptographic schemes are discussed. Application examples will include a protocol for security in a LAN and a secure smart card system for electronic banking. Special consideration will be given to schemes which are relevant for network environments. For all schemes, implementation aspects and up-to-date security estimations will be discussed.

The three areas treated are detailed analysis and the implementation of cryptoalgorithms, advanced protocols, and modern attacks against cryptographic schemes. The first part of the lecture focuses on public key algorithms, in particular ElGamal, elliptic curves and Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The underlying theory of Galois fields will be introduced. Implementation of performance security aspects of the algorithms will be looked at. The second part of the course deals with advanced protocols. New schemes for authentication, identification and zero-knowledge proof will be introduced. Some complex protocols for real-world application\u2014 such as key distribution in networks and for smart cards\u2014will be introduced and analyzed. The third part will look into state-of-the-art cryptoanalysis (i.e., ways to break cryptosystems). Brute force attacks based on special purpose machines, the baby-step giantstep and the Pohlig-Hellman algorithms will be discussed. (Prerequisites: ECE 578\\ CS 578 or equivalent background.)",

Traditional economic analysis using naturally occurring data is often confounded by the complexities of the real world. Economic experiments, on the other hand, give researchers the control required for isolating behaviors of interest. As such, economic experiments can be useful tools for testing existing theories and establishing empirical regularities assisting in the development of new theories. In this course, we cover the basic principles of experimental design. We also study a number of classic experiments, on topics ranging from the efficiency of markets to decision-making under uncertainty and behavioral game theory. Students will participate in mock experiments and will begin putting their new skills into practice by designing their own experiments, which may serve as the basis for IQPs\\MQPs. If time permits, we will discuss some of the basic methods for analyzing experimental data, which presents challenges somewhat different from naturally occurring data due to small sample sizes.

It addresses the environmental carrying capacity and how it is affected by the technology and resources. It discusses tipping points both in contexts of resources and environment and how they differ from private and social optima. It culminates into operational policy interventions for sustaining human activity in the face of ecological limits. The course makes extensive use of games and gaming environments built with system dynamics models to understand issues and policy impacts but does not require model building skills. Recommended background: Working knowledge of economic principles or system dynamics concepts as covered in an introductory economics or system dynamics course such as ECON 1110, ECON 1120, SS1505 or SD1510.",

        "description": "Cat II. This course is a general introduction to the field of development economics. The focus is on ways in which a developing country can increase its productive capacity, both agricultural and industrial, in order to achieve sustained economic growth. The course proceeds by first examining how economic growth and economic development are measured and how the various nations of the world compare according to well-known social and economic indicators. Theories of economic growth and theories of economic development are then examined, as are the various social and cultural structures that are thought to influence economic progress. The inputs to economic growth and development (land, labor, capital, entrepreneurial ability, education, technical change), and the possible distributions of income and levels of employment that result from their use, is considered next. Domestic economic problems and policies such as development planning, the choice of sectorial policies, the choice of monetary and fiscal policies, rapid population growth, and urbanization and urban economic development are then examined. The course concludes with a consideration of international problems and policies such as import substitution and export promotion, foreign debt, foreign investment, and the role of international firms. In conjunction with a traditional presentation of the above topics, the course curriculum will include the use of computer simulation models and games. These materials have been formulated with a simulation technique, system dynamics, that has its origins in control engineering and the theory of servomechanisms. As a result, students will find them complementary to their work in engineering and science. In addition, the various development theories and simulation and gaming results will be related, where possible, to specific developing nations where WPI has on-going project activities (e.g., Costa Rica and Thailand). This course is recommended for those students wishing to do an IQP or MQP in a developing nation. This course will be offered in 2021-22, and in alternating years thereafter. Students may not receive credit for ECON 2125 and ECON 3125. Recommended background: Introductory Microeconomics (Econ 1110)",

The events of the English Reformation profoundly influenced these writers, and their personal struggles against societal institutions have greatly influenced subsequent literary expressions of rage and rebellion.

Students will study plays such as Hamlet, Richard III, and The Winter's Tale alongside accounts by surgeons, doctors, midwives, and others who diagnosed, dissected, and (sometimes) cured.

What can learn about the \u201creal\u201d through studying the fantastic? Course content will vary with each offering. Potential areas of focus might include magical realism, the supernatural and folklore, the gothic and gender, the gothic and race, the contemporary ghost story worldwide, and monstrosity and the grotesque.

Thus, institutions have emerged at the international and transnational levels to coordinate collective problem solving. But governance involves more than just the practicality of problem solving; it also involves uncertainty, controversy, power and politics. This course will examine the ways in which global environmental governance has been conceived: from establishing international institutions and agreements, to less tangible ways of interacting. We will examine themes such as scales of governance (from the United Nations to communities), policy networks, the role of NGOs, think tanks and special interests and the role of knowledge in global environmental debates. Students will then use this conceptual and theoretical basis to analyze major global environmental issues including: deforestation; biodiversity; endangered species; and climate change. The goals of this course are to gain an understanding of the main positions in global environmental debates; critically analyze these positions; and gain insight into the politics of global environmental policy and governance.

        "description": "Cat. I I Environment and development are often seen as incompatible, in part because many poor people in the developing world depend directly on natural resources for their livelihoods. At the same time, poor people are often seen as responsible for causing environmental degradation because they lack the knowledge, skills and resources to manage the environment effectively. The vicious circle is completed as environmental degradation exacerbates poverty. However, optimists argue that poor people can and do contribute positively to environmental outcomes, that states and organizations can facilitate their efforts and that environmental interventions can coincide with development. This course will examine these different perspectives on environmental problems in the developing world through the insights and critiques of social science. Subjects covered include sustainable development, population, environmental risks, gender, urbanization, environmental decision making, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The goals of this course are to think critically about the various links between environment and development and the role of governmental and non-governmental organizations in promoting sustainable development in the developing world.

        "description": "Cat. I I Social media platforms are changing the world of social movements, giving rise to a new generation of social activism. Social media can enable local actors to link with others from across the globe to incite social and environmental change. Social media has enabled people to document and share injustices (e.g., violence; dumping of toxic waste) in places where freedom of the press is limited or non-existent, and it has enabled people across different social groups (race, class, etc.) to engage with one another on issues of shared concern. Social media has also allowed people to share resources (financial, expertise, and organizational) with other social actors across the globe, empowering communities in novel ways. This course introduces students to the phenomena of social and environmental movements, theories on why they succeed and fail, and how social media has changed the landscape of social mobilization. This course will draw on interdisciplinary readings, concepts, and case studies from the social sciences, with emphasis on geography, public policy, sociology, and media studies. Course work will include small group projects, analyses of current social movement cases, and a final project. The final project will consist of interviewing members of a current social movement (potentially using social media), evaluating whether particular social media applications have helped to enable social mobilization, and designing new or revised social media tools to further enhance social mobilization.

Resilient design is the intentional design of buildings, landscapes, communities, and regions in response to these vulnerabilities. In this course, we will work to better understand what is at risk in a changing climate with more extreme and frequent disasters, the role people\\companies and policies play in these disasters, who is most at risk and why, and develop resilient designs focused on practical, innovative, on-the-ground, and just solutions.

        "description": "Systems Thinking is a holistic approach to problem solving that recognizes that system behavior and performance are the result of underlying structures. Systems Thinking provides tools that enable program managers, systems engineers, scientists, economists, and business managers to identify, understand, and control systems in order to improve system performance. The Systems Thinking analysis accounts for feedback and resistance to change often exhibited by real world systems. In this course, students will study system identification and delineation, causal loops and feedback diagrams, stock-and-flow diagrams, system leverage points, delays and oscillations, mental models and unintended consequences, and behavior patterns; and use these concepts to improve the performance of engineering, business, and complex social systems. The course will explore great system failures, how they might have been avoided, and how we can learn from them. Finally, students will learn how Systems Thinking explains the occasional irrational behavior of individuals, departments, businesses, and governments. Examples covered in this course may include the failure of strictly technological \u201cfixes\u201d to social issues (as in the government's installation of wells in Togo in the 1980s,) the 2008 financial meltdown, the failure of the Lockheed L-188 Electra Turboprop Airplane, the failure of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge (\u201cGalloping Gertie\u201d) in 1940, the decline of many commercial fisheries around the world, the failure and success of companies like Research In Motion and Apple, and the unintended consequences of combating drug-related crime.

I This beginning course provides important background for all science and engineering disciplines regarding the capabilities and limitations of materials in our everyday lives. Students are introduced to the fundamental theme of materials science-- structure-property-processing relationships\u2014in metals, ceramics, and plastics. Aspects of material structure range from the atomic to microstructural and macroscopic scales. In turn, these structural features determine the properties of materials. In particular, this course investigates connections between structure and mechanical properties, and how working and thermal treatments may transform structure and thus alter material properties. This knowledge is then applied to material selection decisions. Recommended background: prior knowledge of college-level chemistry.",

How does a flammable mixture of gas or vapor or a suspension of powder or dust particles or droplets form in the industrial processing of these materials? 2. What are gas or dust cloud limits of ignitability, or in other words, what is the range of temperature, pressure, and concentration in which a flame can ignite and propagate? 3. What is the relationship between the flame propagation rate and the associated explosion pressure, and how is it influenced by the combustibility properties of the gas or dust cloud? 4. How does the \u201crate-of-pressure-rise\u201d affect the overall explosion hazard and the viability of various explosion protection measures? 5. How does pressure development within the flammable gas or combustible dust cloud relate to the blast wave pressures propagating away from the cloud and away from the equipment in which the explosion originated? The course explains the physical and thermochemical phenomena pertinent to these questions and provides a mathematical framework for characterizing and applying the answers.",

The course examines the structure of judicial systems, the nature of civil and criminal law, police practice in the enforcement of criminal law, and the responsibilities of judges, attorneys and prosecutors. Additional topics for discussion include the interpretation of precedent and statue in a common law system and how judicial discretion enables interest groups to use courts for social change. The student is expected to complete the course with an understanding of how courts exercise and thereby control the power of the state. As such, courts function as political actors in a complex system of governance. It is recommended that students complete this course before enrolling in GOV 2310, Constitutional Law.

Thus, institutions have emerged at the international and transnational levels to coordinate collective problem solving. But governance involves more than just the practicality of problem solving; it also involves uncertainty, controversy, power and politics. This course will examine the ways in which global environmental governance has been conceived: from establishing international institutions and agreements, to less tangible ways of interacting. We will examine themes such as scales of governance (from the United Nations to communities), policy networks, the role of NGOs, think tanks and special interests and the role of knowledge in global environmental debates. Students will then use this conceptual and theoretical basis to analyze major global environmental issues including: deforestation; biodiversity; endangered species; and climate change. The goals of this course are to gain an understanding of the main positions in global environmental debates; critically analyze these positions; and gain insight into the politics of global environmental policy and governance.

In fact, the relationship between the U.S. and the Caribbean reveals an even more complex narrative characterized by imperialism, racism, migrations, and geopolitical strife. Through case studies, this course will interrogate the impact of U.S. imperialist stance in the Caribbean, as well as Caribbean peoples' responses to that stance. By mapping out the many ways in which the histories of the U.S. and the Caribbean intersect, we will shape our own understanding of this relationship and assess its significance today.

In the first half of the 20th century, this trend accelerated with the rise of redlining, zoning, financial racism, and urban renewal to enforce racial segregation in American cities. At the close of the 20th century, the forces of privatization, deregulation and globalization compounded already dire urban environmental inequities. This course allows student to appreciate how historical urban land use shapes urban ecological patterns and how biological laboratory practices connect to and inform on-going struggles for environmental justice in a postindustrial city. To achieve this integration \u2013 the ground underfoot \u2013 the soil and its microorganisms as well as the history of its use \u2013 will provide the foundation upon which to build connection between biological and historical methodologies. While many recent discussions in urban ecology and design have revolved around \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d and its role in climate resiliency, food justice, heat island mitigation, toxic sequestration, and stormwater management, this course will explore the soils that serves as the foundation for all \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d by supporting broader ecosystem service in the city. Students will register for the course either as BBT 292X or HI331X. The course cannot be double counted or receive credit in both disciplines.",

This course provides an overview of the history of female and non-binary contributors and contributions to this field of study and practice, ranging from Hypatia to Ada Lovelace to NASA visionary Katherine Johnson to queer and trans STEM visionaries Martine Rothblatt, Joan Roughgarden, and Lynn Conway. This course may also consider the following topics: the gender gap in STEM fields, biases in medical research, sexual harassment, eugenics, reproductive justice, transgender rights, and contemporary social movements. The course will also incorporate a deliberate analysis of intersecting identity categories, including race, class, sexuality, religion, and ability.",

The practicum provides opportunities for sustained critical inquiry into a focused thematic area. The practicum seeks to help students learn to communicate effectively, to think critically, and to appreciate diverse perspectives in a spirit of openness and cooperation through research, creativity, and investigation. The specific theme of each practicum will vary and will be defined by the instructor. Prior to enrolling in the practicum, a student must have completed five courses in Humanities and Arts, at least two of which must be thematically related and at least one of which must be at the 2000-level or above. Consent of the instructor is required for enrollment.",

The growth of the Internet and of e-commerce, in particular, have given rise to an entirely new set of legal issues as the courts, Congress and international bodies struggle to keep pace with changing technology. This course addresses the government's role in the development of these technologies and the legal issues that result including questions regarding privacy rights, speech and defamation, and the application of patent and copyright law. Policy questions such as surveillance of e-mail, regulation of content, mandates on the use of filters, and the responsibilities and liability of internet service providers are also discussed. Additional policies studied include attempts to control Internet content and enforce international judgments (resulting from e-commerce or cyber-crime) by foreign states and\\or international organizations. Students are expected to integrate knowledge of technology with law, politics, economics and international affairs.",

The specific topics include physical theories about light, biological and psychological theories of visual perception, and artistic theories and practices concerned with representation. The mixing of material from different academic disciplines is deliberate and meant to counter the notion that human pursuits are \u201cnaturally\u201d arranged in the neat packages found in the modern university. The course draws upon the physical and social sciences, and the humanities, to examine how those fields relate to one another, and how they produce knowledge and self-knowledge. Cultural as well as disciplinary factors are assessed in this process. Light, Vision, and Understanding is conducted as a seminar. The diverse collection of reading materials includes a number of primary texts in different fields. In addition, the students keep a journal in which they record the results of numerous individual observations and experiments concerning light and visual perception. The course can fit into several areas of depth as well as serve as a starting point for an IQP. There are no specific requirements for this course, although some knowledge of college-level physics, as well as an acquaintance with the visual arts, is helpful. This course will be offered in 2020-21, and in alternating years thereafter.",

It allows students to apply the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the Systems Engineering Leadership curriculum. Students are encouraged to select projects with practical significance to their current and future professional responsibilities. Each project is normally conducted in teams of two to four students. They are administered, advised, and evaluated by WPI faculty as part of the learning experience, but students are also encouraged to seek mentorship from experienced systems engineers. (Prerequisites: Since the Capstone Project will draw on knowledge obtained throughout the degree program, it is expected that the student will have completed most or all of the coursework within their plan of study before undertaking the engineering leadership project.)",

This graduate course will introduce students to multiple perspectives on global health and examine the debates and contestations that define this nascent field. Throughout the course, students will be in conversation with different disciplines\u2014anthropology, public health, development studies and gender studies\u2014 and will critically examine global health as ideology and practice. Case studies and examples will primarily be drawn from Africa, North America, and internationally to facilitate cross-cultural comparisons and will focus, inter alia, on recent pandemic outbreaks (e.g., HIV\\AIDS, COVID and Ebola) and long-standing global health challenges like maternal mortality and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). The key topics to be covered in the course will include: history of global health, interdisciplinary perspectives on global health; (de)coloniality and global health architecture, social determinants of health, global health interventions and their successes and failures, and planetary health. This course engages substantially with the following Sustainable Development Goals: no poverty, good health and wellbeing, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, reduced inequalities and partnerships for the goals.

I I Algorithms and programming techniques from artificial intelligence (AI) are key contributors to the experience of modern computer games and interactive media, either by directly controlling a non-player character (NPC) or through more subtle manipulation of the environment. This course will focus on the practical AI programming techniques currently used in computer games for NPC navigation and decision-making, along with the design issues that arise when AI is applied in computer games, such as believability and real-time performance. The course will also briefly discuss future directions in applying AI to games and media. Students will be expected to complete significant software development projects using the studied techniques. Recommended background: object-oriented design concepts (CS 2102 or CS 2103), algorithms (CS 2223), and knowledge of technical game development (IMGD 3000).

Students will read about contemporary challenges in application of these fundamentals to IMGD-related projects, and build disciplinary knowledge and practices necessary for the creation of interactive media and\\or games. Topics covered in this course alternate each year based on instructor. Different instantiations of the course cover topics in programming and computing in media contexts (computation studio), art asset conceptualization, creation, and iteration (visual arts studio), audio remixing and composition methods (audio lab), and narrative in interactive contexts (narrative design lab). This course will be offered each year, with topic defined by the faculty member teaching it.",

This course also emphasizes the communicative strategies needed to sell other people on a design in order to enter production, convince investors, and engage users . Students will be required to design an environment that is populated in a meaningful way that is dependent on the purpose of their visions . They will provide mock-ups of this environment that they must present to their stakeholders - the professor and peers - and finally create prototypes that help them sell their design idea . Throughout the class, students will be writing their designs in professional genres, presenting their designs to the class (often called a pitch), and discuss the theories and practices of design during in-class meetings .

        "description": "This course will cover the same material as MA 1023 Calculus III but from a different perspective. A more rigorous study of sequences and series will be undertaken: starting from the least upper bound property in R, the fundamental theorems for convergent series will be proved. Convergence criteria for series will be rigorously justified and L'Hospital's rule will be introduced and proved. Homework problems will include a blend of computational exercises as usually assigned in MA 1023 Calculus III and problems with a stronger theoretical flavor. Recommended background: Differential and integral calculus (MA1021 and MA 1022, or equivalent). Note: Students can receive credit for this class and MA1023 Calculus III.",

I (14-week course) The topics for integral calculus (MA 1022) are covered in this course: the concept of the definite integral, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, integration techniques, and applications of integration. Applications include: area, volume, arc length, center of mass, work, force, and exponential growth and decay. Logarithmic and exponential functions are studied in depth. Arithmetic and geometric sequences and series will also be covered. Key historical events in the development of integral calculus are examined. Technology will be used as appropriate to support the material being studied. This course extends for 14 weeks and offers 1\\3 unit of credit. It is designed for students who would benefit from additional contact hours and who need to strengthen their mathematical background. Although the course will make use of computers, no programming experience is assumed. Students may not receive credit for both MA 1120 and MA 1022 or MA 1102.",

Students in the course will be expected to explain, justify, defend, disprove, conjecture, and verify mathematical ideas, both verbally and in writing. One expected by-product of this training is that students will develop concrete proof-writing skills which will improve their prospects for success in more advanced mathematics courses. When appropriate, course discussion will touch on current events in the mathematical sciences, including recently solved problems and open challenges facing today's scientists.

        "description": "MA 2631. Probability Theory (Cat I, 1\\3 Units) This course is designed primarily for Mathematical Sciences majors and those interested in the deeper mathematical issues underlying probability theory. The purpose of this course is twofold: (1) To introduce fundamental ideas and methods of mathematics using the study of probability as the vehicle. These ideas and methods will include systematic theorem-proof development starting with basic axioms; mathematical induction; set theory; applications of univariate and multivariate calculus. (2) To introduce the student to probability. Topics to be covered will be chosen from: axiomatic development of probability; independence; Bayes theorem; discrete and continuous random variables; expectation; special distributions including the binomial and normal; moment generating functions; multivariate distributions; conditional and marginal distributions; independence of random variables; transformations of random variables; limit theorems. A more applications-oriented course with similar content is MA 2621 Probability for Applications which is primarily designed for students in departments other than Mathematical Sciences. Credit may not be earned both for this course and for MA 2621. Recommended Background: Multivariable Differential and Integral Calculus (MA 1024, or equivalent). Rationale",

I The mathematical subject of linear programming deals with those problems in optimal resource allocation which can be modeled by a linear profit (or cost) function together with feasibility constraints expressible as linear inequalities. Such problems arise regularly in many industries, ranging from manufacturing to transportation, from the design of livestock diets to the construction of investment portfolios. This course considers the formulation of such real-world optimization problems as linear programming problems, the most important algorithms for their solution, and techniques for their analysis. The core material includes problem formulation, the primal and dual simplex algorithms, and duality theory. Further topics may include: sensitivity analysis; applications such as matrix games or network flow models; bounded variable linear programs; interior point methods.

These algorithms have tremendous impact on the development and practice of modern science and engineering. Class discussions will focus on introducing students to the mathematical theory behind the algorithms as well as their applications. In particular, the course will address issues of computational efficiency, implementation, and error analysis. Algorithms to be considered may include the Krylov Subspace Methods, Fast Multipole Method, Monte Carlo Methods, Fast Fourier Transform, Kalman Filters, and Singular Value Decomposition. Students will be expected to apply these algorithms to real-world problems; e.g., image processing and audio compression (Fast Fourier Transform), recommendation systems (Singular Value Decomposition), electromagnetics or fluid dynamics (Fast Multipole Method, Krylov Subspace Methods, and Fast Fourier Transform), and the tracking and prediction of an object's position (Kalman Filters). In addition to studying these algorithms, students will learn about high performance computing and will have access to a machine with parallel and GPU capabilities to run code for applications with large data sets. Recommended background: Familiarity with matrix algebra and systems of equations (MA 2071, MA 2072, or equivalent), numerical methods for the solution of linear systems or differential equations (MA 3257, MA 3457, or equivalent), and concepts from probability (MA 2621, MA 2631, or equivalent). The ability to write computer programs in a scientific language is assumed. This course will be offered in 2021-22, and in alternating years thereafter.",

Students will learn how to go from a solid (CAD, computer-aided design) model to a machined part, using CAM software (computer-aided manufacturing) and CNC machining. They will also be exposed to associated issues in manufacturing process analysis, engineering design, material science, and in dimensional and surface metrology. Using machining as an example, the science of manufacturing processes is developed in a combination of class work and laboratory experience. The laboratory experience includes an experimental component that relates process variables in machining with performance and machined part quality. Students whose project work will necessitate fabrication of parts and those who want a background in manufacturing process science and engineering should take this course.",

I A course designed to develop analytical and experimental skills in modern engineering measurement methods, based on electronic instrumentation and computer-based data acquisition systems. The lectures are concerned with the engineering analysis and design as well as the principles of instrumentation, whereas the laboratory periods afford the student an opportunity to use modern devices in actual experiments. Lecture topics include: review of engineering fundamentals and, among others, discussions of standards, measurement and sensing devices, experiment planning, data acquisition, analysis of experimental data, and report writing. Laboratory experiments address both mechanical and thermal systems and instrumentation in either traditional mechanical engineering (heat transfer, flow measurement\\visualization, force\\torque\\strain measurement, motion\\vibration measurement) or materials engineering (temperature and pressure measurements in materials processing, measurement of strain and position in mechanical testing of materials). Each year students will be notified which type of experiments will be used in each term offering. Students may also consult with their academic advisor or the Mechanical Engineering department office. Recommended background: mathematics (MA 2051), thermo-fluids (ES 3001, ES 3003, ES 3004), mechanics (ES 2501, ES 2502, ES 2503), materials (ES 2001).",

Stress concentrations, static failures, and fatigue failures are considered for each element type. Emphasis will be placed on knowing the behavior and usage of each element type, being able to select a suitable finite element model for a given problem, and being able to interpret and evaluate the solution quality. A commercial, general-purpose finite element computer program is used to solve problems that are more complex. Projects are used to introduce the use of FEA in the iterative design process.

Explicit solutions for dynamic response of a linear single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system, both damped and undamped, is derived for free-vibration caused by the initial conditions and forced vibration caused by different excitations. Modal analysis is presented to solve for vibration response of both multi-degreeof-freedom (MDOF) systems and continuous systems with distributed parameters. As the basis of modal analysis, the natural frequencies and vibration modes of a linear dynamic system are obtained in advance by solving an associated generalized eigenvalue problem and the orthogonal properties of the vibration modes with respect to the stiffness and mass matrices are strictly proved. Computational methods for vibration analysis are introduced. Applications include but are not limited to cushion design of falling packages, vehicles traveling on a rough surface, multi-story building subjected to seismic and wind loading, and vibration analysis of bridges subjected to traffic loading.

These challenges are compounded by multidisciplinary applications to be developed inexpensively in short time while satisfying stringent design objectives. As a consequence, effective quantitative engineering methodologies, such as optical techniques, are frequently used in the study and optimization of advanced components and systems. In this course, modern laser metrology techniques are discussed and their practical applications to solve problems, with emphasis on nondestructive testing (NDT), are illustrated with laboratory demonstrations. Topics covered include wave and Fourier optics, classic and holographic interferometry, speckle techniques, solid-state lasers, fiber optics, CCD cameras, computer vision, camera calibration methods, and image processing and data reduction algorithms as required in quantitative fringe analysis. Detail examples of nondestructive testing and coherent optical metrology in solid mechanics, vibrations, heat transfer, electromagnetics, and reverse engineering are given. Students are required to work on projects depending on their background and interests. Recommended background: mechanics, materials, physics, knowledge of a high-level computer programming language.

Surface metrology can be important in a wide variety of situations including adhesion, friction, catalysis, heat transfer, mass transfer, scattering, biological growth, wear and wetting. These situations impact practically all the engineering disciplines and sciences. The course begins by considering basic principles and conventional analyses, and methods. Measurement and analysis methods are critically reviewed for utility. Students learn advanced methods for differentiating surface textures that are suspected of being different because of their performance or manufacture. Students will also learn methods for making correlations between surface textures and behavioral and manufacturing parameters. The results of applying these methods can be used to support the design and manufacture of surface textures, and to address issues in quality assurance. Examples of research from a broad range of applications are presented, including, food science, pavements, friction, adhesion, machining and grinding. Students do a major project of their choosing, which can involve either an in-depth literature review, or surface measurement and analysis. The facilities of WPI's Surface Metrology Laboratory are available for making measurements for selected projects. Software for advanced analysis methods is also available for use in the course. No previous knowledge of surface metrology is required. Students should have some background in engineering, math or science.

Design applications are considered primarily, although not exclusively, for the design of manufacturing processes and tools. Axiomatic design is based on the premise that there are common aspects to all good designs. These commons aspects, stated in the independence and information axioms, facilitate the teaching and practice of engineering design as a scientific discipline. Analysis of processes and products is considered from the perspective of supporting product and process design. Fundamental methods of engineering analysis of manufacturing processes with broad applicability are developed. Attention is given to examples from one or more of the following: machining (traditional, nontraditional and grinding), additive manufacturing, and to the production of surface topographies. The ability to generalize from detailed examples is emphasized in order to facilitate the students' ability to development analyses and design methods with broader applicability",

Applications of axiomatic design are considered primarily, although not exclusively, for the design of manufacturing processes and tools. Axiomatic design is a design methodology based on the premise that there are two axioms that apply to all good designs. These axioms facilitate the teaching and practice of engineering design as a scientific discipline. Manufacturing process analysis is considered from the perspective of supporting design. Methods of analysis of manufacturing processes with broad applicability are sought. Special attention is given to examples in machining (traditional, nontraditional and grinding), additive manufacturing, and to the production of surfaces. The ability to find commonalities across applications and generalize is emphasized to facilitate further development of principles with broad applicability. The content is delivered in video lectures and in readings from the technical literature. Homework and quizzes are given and delivered online. There is a project to design a manufacturing process. The topics can be from work or dissertations that can be interpreted as manufacturing processes and tools.

Surface metrology can be important in a wide variety of situations including adhesion, friction, catalysis, heat transfer, mass transfer, scattering, biological growth, wear and wetting. These situations impact practically all the engineering disciplines and sciences. The course begins by considering basic principles and conventional analyses, and methods. Measurement and analysis methods are critically reviewed for utility. Students learn advanced methods for differentiating surface textures that are suspected of being different because of their performance or manufacture. Students will also learn methods for making correlations between surface textures and behavioral and manufacturing parameters. The results of applying these methods can be used to support the design and manufacture of surface textures, and to address issues in quality assurance. Examples of research from a broad range of applications are presented, including, food science, pavements, friction, adhesion, machining and grinding. Students do a major project of their choosing, which can involve either an in-depth literature review, or surface measurement and analysis. The facilities of WPI's Surface Metrology Laboratory are available for making measurements for selected projects. Software for advanced analysis methods is also available for use in the course. No previous knowledge of surface metrology is required. Students should have some background in engineering, math or science.

Lessons concentrate on Army operations and training management, communications and leadership skills and support the beginning of the final transition from cadet to lieutenant. The course focuses cadets, early in the year, on attaining knowledge and proficiency in several critical areas they will need to operate effectively as Army officers. These areas include: the Army's training management system, coordinating activities with staffs, and counseling skills. While the proficiency attained in each of these areas will initially be at the apprentice level, cadets will continue to sharpen these skills as they perform their roles as cadet officers in the ROTC battalion and as new lieutenants after commissioning. At the end of this semester cadets should possess the fundamental skills, attributes, and abilities to operate as competent leaders in the cadet battalion and confidently shoulder the responsibilities entrusted to them. Participation in weekly training leadership laboratories; off campus training sessions (field training exercises) and other special events is required.",

As an expansion of the Ethics instruction in ML 3021, the course starts with an examination of unit ethical climate and the commander's role as the moral anchor of the unit. This is followed by a module addressing military law and leadership. The next module reinforces previous instruction on the organization of the Army and introduces how the Army organizes for operations from the tactical to strategic level. This is followed by instruction on administrative and logistical management that focuses on the fundamentals of soldier and unit level support. Next is a short module that focuses on preparing cadets for their forthcoming commissioning and military service. At the core of this semester is the Advanced Course's Capstone Exercise. This twelve-lesson exercise directly reinforces all modules from this term, and also incorporates and reinforces many learning objectives from modules throughout the entire curriculum. The Capstone Exercise requires cadets, both individually and collectively, to apply their knowledge to solve problems and confront situations commonly faced by junior officers. Upon completion of this course the cadets will be prepared to shoulder the responsibility of being a commissioned officer in the United States Army. Participation in weekly training leadership laboratories; off campus training sessions (field training exercises, Military Staff Ride and other special events is required.",

        "description": "There are three major goals for this course: to establish the underlying principles of calculus, to reinforce students' calculus skills through investigation of applications involving those skills, and to give students the opportunity to develop projects and laboratory assignments for use by first-year calculus students. The course will focus heavily on the use of technology to solve problems involving applications of calculus concepts. In addition, MME students will be expected to master the mathematical rigor of these calculus concepts so that they will be better prepared to develop their own projects and laboratory assignments. For example, if an MME student chose to develop a lab on convergence of sequence, he\\she would be expected to understand the rigorous definition of convergence and how to apply it to gain sufficient and\\or necessary conditions for convergence. The process of developing these first-year calculus assignments will enable the MME students to increase their own mathematical understanding of concepts while learning to handle mathematical and computer issues which will be encountered by their own calculus students. Their understanding of the concepts and applications of calculus will be further reinforced through computer laboratory assignments and group projects. Applications might include exponential decay of drugs in the body, optimal crankshaft design, population growth, or development of cruise control systems. (Prerequisite: MME 532)",

The course will begin with treatment of arithmetic, working through Euclid's algorithm and its applications, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic and its applications, multiplicative functions, the Chinese remainder theorem and the arithmetic of Z\\n. This information will be carried over to polynomials in one variable over the rational and real numbers, culminating in the construction of root fields for polynomials via quotients of polynomial rings. Arithmetic in the Gaussian integers and the integers in various other quadratic fields (especially the field of cube roots of unity) will be explored through applications such as the generation of Pythagorean triples and solutions to other Diophantine equations (like finding integersided triangles with a 60 degree angle). The course will then explore cyclotomy, and the arithmetic in rings of cyclotomic integers. This will culminate in Gauss's construction of the regular 5-gon and 17-gon and the impossibility of constructing a 9-gon or trisecting a 60-degree angle. Finally, solutions of cubics and quartics by radicals will be studied. All topics will be based on the analysis of explicit calculations with (generalized) numbers. The proposed curriculum covers topics that are part of the folklore for high school mathematics (the impossibility of certain ruler and compass constructions), but that many teachers know only as facts. There are also many applications of the ideas that will allow the teachers to use results and ideas from abstract algebra to construct for their students problems that have manageable solutions",

Surface metrology can be important in a wide variety of situations including adhesion, friction, catalysis, heat transfer, mass transfer, scattering, biological growth, wear and wetting. These situations impact practically all the engineering disciplines and sciences. The course begins by considering basic principles and conventional analyses, and methods. Measurement and analysis methods are critically reviewed for utility. Students learn advanced methods for differentiating surface textures that are suspected of being different because of their performance or manufacture. Students will also learn methods for making correlations between surface textures and behavioral and manufacturing parameters. The results of applying these methods can be used to support the design and manufacture of surface textures, and to address issues in quality assurance. Examples of research from a broad range of applications are presented, including, food science, pavements, friction, adhesion, machining and grinding. Students do a major project of their choosing, which can involve either an in-depth literature review, or surface measurement and analysis. The facilities of WPI's Surface Metrology Laboratory are available for making measurements for selected projects. Software for advanced analysis methods is also available for use in the course. No previous knowledge of surface metrology is required. Students should have some background in engineering, math or science.

        "description": "MU 1000: Music and Its Makers (1\\3 unit; Cat. I) This course will introduce students to interdisciplinary music studies by focusing on the people who create musical meaning: performers, composers, listeners, patrons, writers, and more. As we analyze significant musical works, we will also learn about the broader cultural, historical, and social contexts in which they appeared, and the people involved in their creation \u2013 including women and people of color, who are often minimized in discussions of music history. Historical examples will be juxtaposed with contemporary musical works from an array of genres, allowing students to compare today's musical cultures to past ones. Students will also analyze the role of music in their own lives. Recommended background: No prerequisites. A basic reading knowledge of music is helpful, but not required.",

I This course will investigate the sonic organization of musical works and performances, focusing on fundamental questions involved in the process of composition: How do I connect different ideas? How can I make a larger work out of smaller parts? How can I vary statements to create interest without compromising coherence? Where do I start? A progressive series of composition projects will build techniques in relevant areas including rhythm, harmony, melody, and form. Exercises in mechanics will be complemented by contemplation and discussion of artistic, aesthetic and philosophical ideas that are equally important in the compositional process. We will examine the relationship between musical works and how they are communicated as instructions to others (e.g. orally, as symbols, prose, graphic images, or computer programs). Weekly listening, reading, and composition assignments draw on a broad range of musical styles and intellectual traditions from various cultures and historical periods. Recommended background: understanding of basic music theory through coursework (e.g. MU 1511, Introduction to Music or MU 1611, Fundamentals of Music) or equivalent experience.",

This course asks how music functions in relation to movements for social justice, and what aesthetic and formal qualities enable it to do so. Topics may include various popular and vernacular musical traditions created in the modern United States, from Tin Pan Alley to the blues to hip-hop. Focusing especially (but not exclusively) on African American music and musicians , we will consider how music informs calls for justice that are tied to race, class, gender, and sexuality. In addition to asking how music can resist extant arrangements of power, we will consider how it imagines more just futures. There will also be opportunities for creative projects.

The history of automatic mechanical instruments reaches back centuries: we will study past designs so that we can better contextualize modern efforts, which have progressed alongside increasing computational power and machine sensing abilities. We will consider the music that has been composed using such instruments including the works of Anthiel, Nancarrow, Ligeti, Gann, and Metheny. In doing so, we will develop analytical tools required to understand such music and will illuminate relationships between electromechanical capabilities and musical ideas. The technical components of this course will introduce students to principles involved in instrument design, actuators, electronic circuits, microcontrollers, and musical programming environments. We will do all of this with our mind open to the question of how we can design new machines to make new kinds of music. Recommended Background: Fundamentals of Music I and \\ or Fundamentals of Music II, experience with programming and electronic circuits is helpful.

How do we organize these elements in time to create rhythms, melodies, phrases and pieces? How do perception and memory interact to allow us navigate a musical work? We will explore these questions by considering the cognitive and perceptual processes that shape our musical experience. Topics will include event distinction, temporal perception, hierarchical organization, perceptual grouping, expertise, memory and categorization . We will illustrate these ideas in musical contexts by listening to a variety of musical works . We will consider how psychological principles are applied to music technologies, such as compression algorithms, mixing methodologies and the field of music information retrieval . We will consider experiments that focus on some of these topics to further our understanding about how we experience music .

Along with the music, there may also be discussion of individual artists who have been outspoken about social issues, such as Leonard Bernstein in the 1960s, Dimitri Shostakovich under Stalin's rule, and contemporary pop and jazz artists. Recommended background: Basic knowledge of reading music, such as personal experience, participation in ensembles, or music courses (MU 1611: Fundamentals of Music I, or MU 1511: Introduction to Music).

It examines how gender \u2013 like other markers of identity \u2013 is a vector of political and social power, and it considers music's role in both reflecting and shaping that power . To do this work, we will pair musical case studies with theoretical texts from women's and gender studies. Topics include the musical construction of masculinity and femininity; the relationship between music and queer and trans identities; and the role of music in feminist movements past and present. Students will have the opportunity to complete hands-on research projects. Units: 1\\3, Category: II Recommended background: No prerequisites.

Initially, theories will be developed concerning the effects of radiation exposure on basic biological systems, such as a virus or a cell. These theories will be based on our knowledge of radiation interaction mechanisms at the atomic\\molecular level coupled with our knowledge of cell biology. Once developed, these theories will be compared against experimental observations and expanded to include cellular kinetic responses to radiation. Focus will then shift from the simple cell to more complex biological organisms. Ultimately, the student will be expected to appreciate the practical aspects and consequences of human radiation exposure and to properly apply this information in a radiation safety or medical physics environment.",

        "description": "This capstone course serves as a practical integration of the operations and supply chain theories, practices, tools and techniques that students learned in their MS program. The medium is a major team-based project, sponsored by an external organization. The course goals are: (1) to enrich students' experiential learning and support the acquisition of the skills and capabilities to tackle real-world problems; and (2) to enhance students' teamwork, interpersonal and consulting skills. Students will produce a written report documenting their solutions, and providing the financial, organizational, and technical rationale for their approach. They will also formally present their results to the project sponsors. Students are expected to have completed (or be currently completing) all the course requirements for their MS in Operations and Supply Chain Analytics prior to taking the capstone project.",

However, there has been a resurgence of interest since the 1960's that has steadily brought this area of research to the fore. The most recent observations of gravity waves, black holes, and the development of the global positioning system, \u2013 all have excited scientists and the general public about Einstein's theory.

In this course, we will explore these questions and many more as we learn about cross-cultural psychology. Crosscultural psychology is the study of cultural effects on human behavior and diversity. We will examine theoretical perspectives and empirical findings in cross-cultural psychology. This course will cover topics such as: development, understanding the self, cognition, communication (verbal and nonverbal), emotion, relationships, prejudice, gender, mental and physical health, and what it means to live and work in a diverse and multicultural society. We will examine these issues both within the cultural groups in the United States as well as cultures around the globe. This course is designed to increase awareness and sensitivity to issues pertaining to diversity and differences among people and to allow for discussions on these sensitive topics.

Specifically, we will examine the brain bases of social judgments, the experience and regulation of emotions, empathy, attachment, theory of mind, sexual attraction, romantic love, and neuroeconomics, among other topics. Along the way we will learn about a variety of methodological approaches used by social neuroscientists, including social psychology paradigms, lesion studies, patient research, and functional neuroimaging. Coursework will include group projects and presentations that summarize various social phenomena that may be of interest (e.g., social rejection) and their neural underpinnings, as well as opportunities to work with real brain data collected at WPI and other neuroimaging sites.

How do we organize these elements in time to create rhythms, melodies, phrases and pieces? How do perception and memory interact to allow us navigate a musical work? We will explore these questions by considering the cognitive and perceptual processes that shape our musical experience. Topics will include event distinction, temporal perception, hierarchical organization, perceptual grouping, expertise, memory and categorization . We will illustrate these ideas in musical contexts by listening to a variety of musical works . We will consider how psychological principles are applied to music technologies, such as compression algorithms, mixing methodologies and the field of music information retrieval . We will consider experiments that focus on some of these topics to further our understanding about how we experience music .

Epistemologists ask such questions as: How should we define knowledge? Is knowledge generated by reason or experience? How has knowledge of nature been represented in Western philosophy and science? Is knowledge objective? What constitutes adequate justification for holding a belief? Do attributions of epistemic credibility vary among knowers from different social, cultural, and economic locations? How do power and ideology shape our experiences of the world? Students explore questions such as these and others as they submit their own beliefs about the nature of knowledge to philosophical examination. The course readings and situating context for inquiry will vary each time the course is taught, with each iteration focusing on a particular period or school of philosophical thought. Possible contexts include seventeenth century philosophy or other periods in the history of philosophy, critical theory, pragmatism, analytic philosophy, phenomenology, and feminist philosophy.

Does the history of science, which includes many refutations of theories once believed to be true, raise questions about whether currently accepted theories should be trusted? By what methods does a scientific community validate knowledge claims and how are these processes affected by social, political, and economic contexts? Does a scientist have a responsibility to conduct morally conscientious research? How does the development of technology affect our spiritual and moral characters?

        "description": "Cat. I This course offers a general introduction to modern moral theory. What makes one action wrong, and another right? What are our moral duties towards others? Do moral values change over time, making beliefs about right and wrong simply \"relative,\" or are moral values objective, holding true for all people, everywhere, at all times? Should emotions play a role in ethical deliberation, or should we aspire to be purely rational when engaged in moral thought and action? Is it okay to cheat on an exam, so long as everybody else does it? Do we have a right to use animals in laboratory experiments? Is eating meat ethical? Is it wrong to share a racist or sexist joke? Should abortion be legal? Students will learn how to apply key moral concepts to real-world problems and situations after closely studying several moral theories, including utilitarianism, Kantianism, and feminist care ethics. Other topics covered include moral relativism, psychological hedonism, and ethical egoism.",

Students will engage with interrupt service routines, state machines, and event-driven programming, crucial for process and state management in robotics. The course emphasizes the implementation of both software and hardware timers for robotic control and scheduling. A key focus of the course is on the electronic components of robots, including studies of op-amps and power\\control circuits, equipping students with the skills to design and manage robot electronics. The course includes analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters, essential for converting sensory data between analog and digital formats. Students will explore communication techniques (SPI, I2C, PWM, etc.), vital for data exchange in robotic systems, and gain comprehensive knowledge of digital and analog electronics for effective sensor and actuator interfacing. The course also covers DC motors and DC motor control (speed, torque, and direction), analog filters for signal processing, sensor calibration, and an introduction to control systems, focusing on PID controllers. Laboratory sessions consist of hands-on exercises where students design and test electronic subsystems interfacing a robot for specific tasks. Compared to ECE 2049, this course explores more peripherals' practical applications in robotics systems but does not dive as deeply into microcontroller architecture. Students may apply RBE 2020 to the Embedded Systems requirement in Robotics Engineering. Credit is not permitted for both RBE 2020 and ECE 2049, regardless of major. Additionally, students cannot receive credit for both RBE 2020 and RBE 200X. Recommended Background: RBE 1001; fundamentals of electronics, such as found in ECE 2010; and programming experience, such as covered in CS 2119, CS 2102\\3, CS 2301\\3, or ECE 2039.",

        "description": "This course introduces students to the concepts, techniques, and technologies involved with designing real-world systems software for robotics. Software for robot systems presents unique challenges, because of its inherent real-time, asynchronous, and distributed nature, as well as robots' interaction with the physical world. The course can be understood as a \u201cbuild your own Robot Operating System (ROS) \u201d, in that its philosophy is to expose the students to the design and implementation challenges involved in creating systems software of this kind. In the first part of the course, the students will be introduced to foundational software architectures for robotics such as finite state machines, behavior trees, the subsumption architecture, and publish-subscribe architectures. The students will explore how to implement and combine these architectures into a coherent software framework. The second part of the course deals with fault and error management, specifically on the impact of these adverse events on architecture design. The final project will challenge the students to deploy and demonstrate their own software platform for navigation on a real robotic platform. RBE majors may use this course to fulfill their Software Engineering requirement. RBE\\CS double majors should consider taking CS 3733 as it counts towards both majors. Recommended Background: Significant programming experience with an object-oriented language, such as Python or C++ , as found in CS 2102 . Fundamentals of robot motion and control, for example as found in RBE 2001 and RBE 2002 .",

Safety and Guarantees for Autonomous Robots (3 credits) Robotic and AI systems have strong potential to directly impact our well-being, from self-driving cars to medical robots. Therefore, it is important to consider strong guarantees on the correctness and safety of their behavior. These guarantees ensure the robot will execute the desired behavior and will not execute undesired behavior. The course will define formal notions of system properties such as safety and liveness, explain how to model and analyze those properties in systems that make decisions and act on them, and understand the specific challenges related to making guarantees on embodied AI systems. This course will cover many topics related to formal guarantees of safety and correctness in robotic and AI systems, including temporal logicbased planning, safe control via invariants and control barrier functions, neural net verification, closed loop control with machine learning components, safe reinforcement learning, and other state-of-the-art topics at the intersection of safety, guarantees, AI, and robotics.

How do attributions of same and different, normal and abnormal, rational and irrational, human and nonhuman shape social and political processes of inclusion and exclusion? Are social categories real, constructed, or both? This course focuses primarily on intersectional approaches to oppression and identity that see social categories such as gender, race, and class as mutually constitutive rather than separable. Course readings span a range of philosophical and religious traditions including Continental philosophy, analytic philosophy, Latina\\o studies, feminist theory, queer theory, critical race theory, disability studies, and environmental studies.

Do moral values change over time, making beliefs about right and wrong simply \"relative,\" or are moral values objective, holding true for all people, everywhere, at all times? Should emotions play a role in ethical deliberation, or should we aspire to be purely rational when engaged in moral thought and action? Is it okay to cheat on an exam, so long as everybody else does it? Do we have a right to use animals in laboratory experiments? Is eating meat ethical? Is it wrong to share a racist or sexist joke? Should abortion be legal? Students will learn how to apply key moral concepts to real-world problems and situations after closely studying several moral theories, including utilitarianism, Kantianism, and feminist care ethics. Other topics covered include moral relativism, psychological hedonism, and ethical egoism.",

        "description": "Cat. I I Patriarchal religious traditions are often characterized by masculine images of the Divine, cisgendered male religious authority, male-authored scriptures and a heteronormative gendered division of religious practices. As a result, men and cultural masculinity are differently valued than women and cultural femininity; this male-female binary leaves little room for practitioners who identify as nonbinary. In this discussion-focused course, we will engage representations of gender and sexuality in different traditions and their impact on larger social contexts from philosophical, theological and ethnographic perspectives. Among the questions we will explore: Why does the idea of a female or feminine YHWH, God or Allah bother us? Can feminine representations (such as the Devi, Shakti or Shekhinah) or nonbinary representations (such as two-spirit people in indigenous communities) facilitate gender equity? Do mystical traditions (such as the Zohar or Sufism) encourage gender fluidity? How do religions influence sexuality; how does sexuality intersect with creation myths and cosmogonies? Why is a Buddhist nun expected to bow to a Buddhist monk; why does the Catholic Church not recognize women, nonbinary and \\ or queer priests? This combination of theoretical and methodological conversations will offer students a forum in which to recast assumptions about individual and collective identity that permeate our cultural systems and structures.

Starting with Europeans' first impressions of the New World, we will grapple with the interplay between local cultures and the expansion of global capitalism in Latin America by analyzing literary and cultural representations of, for instance, resource extraction of rubber, wood, and petroleum in the Amazon (Brazil, Per, Ecuador); maquiladora contamination and environmental migration in the borderlands (U.S.-Mexico); water defenders and neoliberalism (Chile, Bolivia); Indigenous social movements in defense of land; nature (Ecuador); eco-feminist parallels between oppression of women and nature (Honduras, Colombia); and natural disasters, especially in the age of the Anthropocene (Mexico, Puerto Rico). We will explore these issues and more to unearth the role of Latin American cultural production in bearing witness to and generating awareness of environmental crises. While consistently accounting for the region's complex and interwoven history of coloniality, inequality, and dependency, we will look for ecological justice solutions proposed at the intersection of art and activism. Several questions will guide our interpretations grounded in ecocritical theory: What do the studied works aim to achieve by appealing to harmony between the human and the non-human? What similarities or differences exist across countries, contexts, and genres? How does Latin America's ecological consciousness differ from other peripheries and centers?

The course provides a foundation for MBSE by first introducing SysML as a descriptive language for modeling systems in terms of their requirements, structure, behavior, and parametric constraints. The course then introduces the Object-Oriented Systems Engineering Method (OOSEM) as a method for applying SysML to support the specification, architecture design, analysis, and verification of complex systems. A systems modeling tool is also introduced and used throughout the course. Applying MBSE on class projects help the student to grasp the fundamentals. This course is expected to provide the foundations of the systems modeling language, method, and tool to enable the student to get started with MBSE on real projects.

        "description": "WPE 1613: Succeeding as an Introvert (Graded; 1\\12units; Cat I) Does spending time in crowds or at a party wear you out? Do you enjoy time alone? Does the thought of working on a team make you nervous? Are you quiet around your classmates? Do you tend to avoid small talk or get tongue-tied in large groups? Would you rather think about a problem than discuss it with others? If you answered \u201cyes\u201d to several of these questions, this course is for you. Society puts a strong emphasis on extroversion, and those who frequently speak up get more attention and often advance professionally more quickly than their more reserved peers. Yet some of our greatest thinkers and leaders have been introverts. While the teamwork culture of WPI and most professions can present challenges to introverts, career success depends on the ability to work with others. This course will help introverted students learn to thrive at college and throughout their careers. Students will learn about the nature of introversion, including the strengths and challenges of being an introvert. Students will also learn personal and professional skills, such as how to successfully work on a team, present to an audience, manage their energy levels, and have difficult conversations with others. Grades will be A,B,C\\NR.",

The ultimate goal of the course is to help students write sentences and paragraphs that are clear, concise, and graceful. In the first part of the course, students will review parts of speech, basic sentence types, and sentence and paragraph structure in order to understand how sentences are put together and the impact their construction has on readers. Then, through hands-on writing exercises and extensive revision of their own and others' writing, students will learn strategies for tightening their prose (concision), achieving \u201cflow\u201d (cohesion and coherence) and improving usage (language specificity and precision). Recommended background: Basic knowledge of rhetorical writing (e.g., WR 1010, Elements of Writing, WR 1011, Writing About Science & Technology, or WR 1020, Introduction to Rhetoric.",

It also generates new questions about authorship, responsibility, creativity, authenticity, and other rhetorical constructs that affect us equally as citizens and professionals. This course offers the foundations of critical AI literacy. It aims to help students develop a robust understanding of what this transformation means, and what kind of new sensibilities and skills are needed in response to an AI-led transformation. The course focuses on: 1) technological and cultural trends that shape the perception of generative AI, 2) ethical concerns emerging from the use of generative AI in professional and nonprofessional contexts, and 3) effective and responsible practices of using generative AI in writing and other forms of communication. In addition to reading assignments, students will have the opportunity to experiment with generative AI and assess its limits and possibilities. The assignments include critical annotations, fact-checking procedures, creative workflow processes, ethical analyses, and interaction design inquiries. Recommended Background: None",

Some of them actively contribute to the creation and communication of new sets of ethical standards, such as the work done by IEEE's Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems. What are the ethical principles that underpin these new standards? Since robots and AI systems are designed to work with or alongside humans, do people have a right to understand what autonomous systems are doing and why? How can roboticists and AI designers ensure that these systems are transparent and explainable? This course focuses on the communication of ethical and social impacts of scientific research and technology development. After learning about major debates in robot\\AI\\data ethics, students will cultivate skills to (1) conceptualize ethical inquiries in technology design and (2) articulate them in writing and other forms of scholarly communication . As part of this course, students will learn to apply the National Science Foundation's (NSF) broader impacts framework to their writing projects (dissertation, thesis, journal publication, grant application, etc.).",
